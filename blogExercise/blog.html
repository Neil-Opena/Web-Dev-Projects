<h2>This is my first article</h2>
<p class="mark">Red Five standing by. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- What?!
What?! I find your lack of faith disturbing. Ye-ha! As you wish. You don't believe in the Force, do you?</p>

<p>I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
Don't underestimate the Force. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? As you wish. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!
</p>

<p>I find your lack of faith disturbing. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.
Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?</p>

<p class="mark">Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!

<p>What?! Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.
What?! He is here. Red Five standing by. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.</p>
