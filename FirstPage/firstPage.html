<p> <em> Lorem Ipsum </em> is <strong>simply dummy </strong> text of the printing and typesetting industry. <em> Lorem Ipsum </em> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the <span> 1500s </span>, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <span> 1960s</span> with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of <em> Lorem Ipsum. </em> </p>
